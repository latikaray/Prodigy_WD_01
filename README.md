# Prodigy_WD_01
This is task ONE of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

Welcome to the **PRODIGY_WD_01** repository! As an intern at Prodigy Infotech, I've developed an interactive navigation menu that showcases a responsive landing page of a music App!
. Here are the key features:

1. **Interactive Menu:**
   - The navigation menu consist of various options that changes color when scrolled or hovered over.
   - Also, as you go from a desktop to mobile size, It changes responsively to showcase a navigating bar with a slider hamburger.

2. **Music App:**
   - The menu displays the landing page of a music app.
   - You'll find an appealing hero section along with paths to download the app(imaginary paths).

3. **Code Files:**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure.
   - `style.css`: Defines the menu's appearance.
   - `main.js`: Handles interactivity.
